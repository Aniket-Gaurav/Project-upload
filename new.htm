            Various Human Activities That Affect an Ecosystem
        </p>
        <p>1. Agriculture <br>
            <br>
            With the ever-increasing number of the world’s population, there is similarly a soaring demand for
            sufficient food. The population growth rate is hence driving the world to clear forests in order to create
            more room for agriculture. Based on data by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), more than 40% of
            earth’s surface now supports agriculture, and a bigger fraction of these lands were formerly covered by
            forests. The result is devastating, as discussed below...
            i) Destruction of Wildlife

            Forests are critical habitats for wildlife, and as ecosystems supporting the intricate relationship between
            the living and non-living things, they have been adversely affected by agricultural practices. A larger
            percentage of Europe, for example, was densely covered with temperate forests, but with time it has been
            cleared to make room for farmland
            ii) Global Warming and Climate Change

            Population growth-influenced deforestation is to blame for three billion tons of CO2 released into the
            atmosphere each year, which is equivalent to the destruction of 13 million hectares of land annually as put
            forward by the Union of Concerned Scientists. This rate of deforestation affects the ecosystem by raising
            global temperatures and disrupting the cycle of condensation and evaporation
            Various ecosystems, such as the Polar regions, are, in turn, affected by the rising global temperatures and
            changes in the atmospheric water cycle.
            iii) Aquatic Resources Degradation

            The injection of vast amounts of phosphorous and nitrogen nutrients into natural soils, lands and water
            systems due to fertilizer use have created far-reaching effects, altered ecosystems, and rapidly expanded
            aquatic dead zones.
        <p>
            <center>2. Deforestation</center> <br>
<br>
            Deforestation occurs when a forest or stand of trees is removed, converting the land to a non-forest use.
            This changes the ecosystem drastically and results in a dramatic loss of biodiversity. With an exponential
            expansion in human beings, more food, materials, and shelter are being manufactured at stupendous rates,
            mostly stemming from forestry. Deforestation can be the result of timber harvesting or of clearing land for
            agricultural, commercial, or residential use.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Overpopulation & Overconsumption <br>
<br>
            Overpopulation has grown into an epidemic since mortality rates have decreased, medicine has improved, and
            methods of industrial farming were introduced, thus keeping humans alive for much longer and increasing the
            total population.

            One of the most severe effects of overpopulation is the degradation of the environment. Humans require lots
            of space, whether it is for farmland or industries. An increased population results in more clear-cutting,
            resulting in severely damaged ecosystems. Without enough trees to filter the air, CO₂ levels increase, which
            carries the potential to damage every single organism on Earth.

            Another issue is humans consume large amounts of resources for their own needs. Some examples include the
            mining of natural resources like coal, the hunting and fishing of animals for food, and the clearing of
            forests for urbanization and wood use.

            The extensive overuse of nonrenewable resources, like fossil fuels, can cause great harm to the environment.
            The larger the population, the more fossil fuels will be used, and this results in copious amounts of carbon
            dioxide into the air- threatening the extinction of thousands of species.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. Plastic Production <br>
<br>
            The invention of plastic has created one of the most problematic pollution problems ever witnessed on the
            face of earth. Waste plastic is everywhere on earth, even in the oceans. Plastics remain in the environment
            for thousands of years and have long-lasting consequences on the fragile ecosystems and regulatory cycles.

            Presently, the world produces nearly 300 million tons of plastics yearly, and 20% to 40% of this winds up in
            the landfills with 10 to 20 million tons finding a way into the world’s oceans, interrupting aquatic life.
            Plastics floating in the world oceans are estimated to amount to 5.2 trillion weighing a total of 268,940
            tons, based on a research study done by the World Watch Institute.

            The chemicals present in the plastics are released in the waters, interfering with animal’s endocrine
            systems and changing their reproduction patterns. They can also cause rapid cell division, which may result
            in cancers. Above all, since the plastics remain in the oceans for years and years, they can ultimately
            reverse ecosystems with damage costs approximated at 13 billion US dollars in a year.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. Emission of Carbon Dioxide and Other Greenhouse Gases <br>
<br>
            The emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, namely methane and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), are
            human-induced through the combustion of fossil fuels and the use of man-made products. In a bid to generate
            energy, the world has continued to depend on carbon-rich fossil fuels, namely gas, oil and coal.
        </p>
        The combustion of these fossil fuels to produce energy in the years between 1870 and 2013 produced approximately
        400 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Today, carbon dioxide levels are said to be surprisingly
        higher than ever in history. As a result, global temperatures are on the rise contributing to sea-level rise and
        extreme weather events like heatwaves, flooding, tsunamis, and droughts.

        The sea-level rise and extreme weather events have, in turn, altered ocean and land ecosystems, impacted food
        chains and biodiversity, and intensified desertification.
        </p>
        <p>
            8. Draining Streams/Rivers and Destruction of Critical Freshwater Aquifer Recharge Areas (Water Pollution) <br>
<br>
            Various anthropogenic activities have heavily destroyed freshwater supplies such as rivers, streams, and
            aquifers. Intensive agriculture is a leading cause on account of the large amounts of chemical fertilizers,
            herbicides and other agrochemicals that find a way into waterways.

            Intensive agriculture is also water-intensive, thus over-drains rivers and degrades critical freshwater
            aquifer recharge areas. The construction of man-made dams and water-diversion for irrigation or during
            infrastructural construction has also made the natural flow of water in rivers and streams inefficient.

            As such, these practices have gradually destroyed freshwater recharge capabilities, increased salt
            intrusion, and changed local weather patterns, in turn affecting local ecosystems such as forests, lakes and
            wetlands.
        </p>
        <p>9. Overhunting and Overexploitation <br>
<br>
            Overhunting and overexploitation of natural resources through activities like overfishing and mining have
            caused a reduction in the number of varied plant and animal species. In other words, the diverse existence
            of animal and plant species in different habitats has been widely affected by overhunting and
            overexploitation. These human activities do not give room for the replenishment, growth, or new development
            of already exploited or harvested products.

            Overhunting can cause extinction, destroy natural reserves and breading areas, and affects food chains.
            Therefore, whenever any living thing or native species that play a part in an ecosystem is taken away in
            large quantities or becomes extinct, the entire ecosystem suffers and can be permanently altered.

            Also, when humans convert forests into farmlands or river basins into mining areas, the areas are made harsh
            for the survival of animal and plant species.</p>
        <p>10. Genetic Modifications <br>
<br>
            The globe’s escalating demand for food products has prompted scientists to resort to the use of genetically
            modified organisms (GMOs) to increase crop yields. GMOs also come with the advantage of being more tolerant
            of extreme temperatures, the ability to flourish with less water, and better ability to resist parasites and
            diseases.

            On the other hand, GMOs also come with new biological elements that can impact natural ecosystems in
            numerous ways, as reported by different environmental groups. One is changing the natural ways of
            competition or predation. Secondly, soil microbial populations regulating the flow of phosphorous, nitrogen
            and other important elements can equally be impacted. Thirdly, genetic materials can be transferred to other
            native populations.

            All these GMO concerns can irreversibly terminate life at some point – a chance of “total ecocide” as
            reported by Global Research (Centre for Research on Globalization).</p>

        <h1 class="rd">What are the health consequences of air pollution on populations?</h1>
        <h3>Exposure to high levels of air pollution can cause a variety of adverse health outcomes. It increases the
            risk of respiratory infections, heart disease and lung cancer. Both short and long term exposure to air
            pollutants have been associated with health impacts. More severe impacts affect people who are already ill.
            Children, the elderly and poor people are more susceptible. The most health-harmful pollutants – closely
            associated with excessive premature mortality – are fine PM2.5 particles that penetrate deep into lung
            passageways.
        Major sources of ambient air pollution include inefficient modes of transport (polluting fuels and
            vehicles), inefficient combustion of household fuels for cooking, lighting and heating, coal-fired power
            plants, agriculture, and waste burning</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1 class="ras">Do Individuals Matter?</h1>
        <h3>When we discuss the earth's environment, we are talking about the health of the atmosphere, forests, plants,
            animals, water, and each ecosystem. Everything from the roots of trees underground to the air we breathe is
            part of the environment, and the health of each part affects the health of the whole. There are a lot of
            threats to the environment. These include climate change caused by greenhouse gasses, air and water
            pollution, deforestation, and more. As a result of so many serious environmental threats, the earth is
            changing. Melting glaciers are destroying habitat in the Arctic; plants and animals are becoming extinct at
            a staggering rate. It's easy to look at that list and feel small and insignificant. After all, the earth has
            over 7 billion people.

            But, the idea that individuals can't affect change is a myth. Every person has to make his or her own
            choices about protecting the environment. If everyone in a democracy decided their vote didn't matter,
            nobody would vote. If democracy can work, then so can environmental action. Think of it this way: all of us
            have created this problem by neglecting the environment. That must mean that all of us can fix the problem
            by protecting it! </h3>
        <p class="ras">Everyday Actions</p>
        <h3>There are actions everyday people can take to protect the environment:

            First, we can recycle, reuse, and compost. Recycling involves cutting down on waste and energy consumption
            by turning used items such as plastic bottles into new items. Reusing involves cutting down on waste by
            reusing items such as grocery bags. Composting involving using food waste to help create nutrient-rich soil
            rather than landfill waste. The average American creates 4.3 pounds of waste every day. Much of that waste
            ends up in landfills, where it produces greenhouse gases that make climate change worse. Some of it ends up
            in the ocean, where it kills marine life. And, creating new products uses up a lot of energy. Yet, almost
            all of our waste can be recycled, reused, or composted.

            Transport conservation is another thing we can do since one of the biggest sources of greenhouses gases is
            transportation. Make better transport choices by choosing the least damaging option. Generally speaking,
            driving is more efficient than flying. Riding a bike is always better than driving. Take a train, tram, or
            bus whenever one is available. Choose housing near to where you go to school or work, and choose an
            efficient car. All of these things can reduce your impact on the environment.

            Another way you can help the environment is to conserve energy. Switch things off when you're not using
            them, use less air conditioning (or use fans), dry clothes on a clothesline, switch to energy saving light
            bulbs (LED bulbs are the best!), turn your refrigerator down, close air conditioning vents when you're not
            in the room, wear more layers instead of setting the heating too high, and turn everything off when not at
            home. You can make the biggest difference by turning off your a/c and turning down your heat. All these
            things help protect the environment though, and they save you money! </h3>

        <p>Ten Simple Things You Can Do to Help Protect the Earth</p>
        <!--write under boxes  -->
        Reduce, reuse, and recycle. Cut down on what you throw away. Follow the three "R's" to conserve natural
        resources and landfill space.
        Volunteer. Volunteer for cleanups in your community. You can get involved in protecting your watershed, too.
        Educate. When you further your own education, you can help others understand the importance and value of our
        natural resources.
        Conserve water. The less water you use, the less runoff and wastewater that eventually end up in the ocean.
        Choose sustainable. Learn how to make smart seafood choices at www.fishwatch.gov.
        Shop wisely. Buy less plastic and bring a reusable shopping bag.
        Use long-lasting light bulbs. Energy efficient light bulbs reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Also flip the light
        switch off when you leave the room!
        Plant a tree. Trees provide food and oxygen. They help save energy, clean the air, and help combat climate
        change.
        Don't send chemicals into our waterways. Choose non-toxic chemicals in the home and office.
        Bike more. Drive less.

        <p>How the Government Helps in Saving the Earth</p>
        <h1>
            1-Restore the natural part of the ecosystem
        </h1>
        <h2>Protecting the forests, rivers, oceans, and wetlands are the keys to save the environment.</h2>
        <h1>2-Help small producers in the agricultural industry</h1>
        <h2>There are local producers who practice sustainable ways of food production. Aside from that, the numbers of
            people who are becoming vegetarians are already increasing. However, the best thing about this is the
            respect given to the local producers.</h2>
        <h1>3-Promote green energy</h1>
        <h2>The more development in a country, the more energy will be needed to produce. Before, the cheapest options
            are the thermoelectric and hydroelectric energies. But, now because of technological developments,
            government can able to find better options.</h2>
        <h1>Encourage Environmentally Friendly Employee Practices</h1>
        <h2>Coach all employees to be conscious of saving energy. Encourage employees to turn off lights in rooms that
            aren’t in use, such as storerooms, restrooms and breakrooms.

            Instruct employees to turn off computers, printers and power strips at the end of the workday. Ask employees
            to delay turning lights and office equipment back on the next day until they really need to use them. Make
            sure that monitors are set on the most energy-efficient settings and eliminate screensavers on computers.
        </h2>
        <h1>Making Environmentally Friendly Changes in Local Government Facilities</h1>
        <h2>

            Replace incandescent bulbs with fluorescent or LED bulbs. Rearrange office furniture and add window
            coverings that allow for as much natural sunlight to flood the workspace as possible.

            Your breakroom or lunchroom is a good place to start. Replace paper and plasticware with reusable dishes
            that employees can wash rather than throw away. Add some recycling bins as a visible reminder to recycle.
            Request vending machine servicers to fill machines with healthy drinks and snacks, such as fruit juices,
            granola, fruit and pretzels. Provide a water cooler to reduce the collection of plastic water bottles in the
            office. Healthier eating leads to a healthier lifestyle, and local governments are bound to reap the rewards
            with employees who take fewer sick days</h2>
        <h1>Ways to Share Your Environmentally Friendly Efforts Publicly</h1>
        <h2>It’s likely that your efforts to go green won’t go unnoticed. As long as you’re making the effort to create
            big changes, take the time to promote the benefits of creating an environmentally friendly workplace by
            writing an informative post about it on your Civic Web Portal, a citizen page that seamlessly integrates
            with your local government website. It’s a fantastic way to demonstrate to citizens how small changes can
            generate a big impact on our environment.</h2>
